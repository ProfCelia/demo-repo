# Git and GitHub

Git is an amazing VCS (version control system) it is amazing because it is conceptually simple. And it is amazing because of GitHub which makes it possible to destribute project files to anyone on the internet. Perhaps, it's sort of a Facebook for developers! (I hope it isn't that bad!)

To effectively use Git/GitHub you will have to become familiar with a number of tools. 

Chief among these tools are:

1. CLI - the Command Line Interface and it's associated commands
2. git - runs on your computer and mediates your connection to GitHub
3. GitHub  - The onlie version of Git where you can find and clone other projects as well as update your projects and share your work with others. Your GitHub repositories can become the major part of your portfolio of work.
